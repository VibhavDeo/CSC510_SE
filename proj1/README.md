# Project Overview
CalorieApp is an easy to use application that keeps track of a user's daily calories gained and burnt. It can help the user to set goals such as weight loss/gain where users can edit their profile by entering their height, weight, goal and target-weight. Users can also enroll into numerous programs involving fitness such as yoga classes and workout sessions. The application allows users can now connect with their friends by sending a friend-request and share their progress.
